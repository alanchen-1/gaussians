# Gaussians
This repository houses various experiments with Gaussians, random matrix theory, and matrix completion problems.

To run and try generating the graphics yourself, clone the repository and run `main.ipynb`.

## Notes
- `utils/` contains all the necessary libraries for both random matrix generation, plotting, and the matrix completion sampling.
- `results/` contains some example graphics that I generated using `main.ipynb`.
